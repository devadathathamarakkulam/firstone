    <h1>Painting</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"[1] or "support").[2] The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.</p>
    <h2><i><strong>history</strong></i></h2>
    <p>The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old, found in both the Franco-Cantabrian region in western Europe, and in the caves in the district of Maros (Sulawesi, Indonesia).</p>

In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting.</p> </small>
